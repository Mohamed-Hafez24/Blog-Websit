# Blog Website
It is a Website build using HTML5 and CSS3. 
This project was built from scratch, and it is a part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program.
I worked on the structure of the files by making a folder for styles and another one for images. Also, added a custom design and style for the Blog.
It is totally responsive to different screens using media queries, Grid, and Flexbox systems.
